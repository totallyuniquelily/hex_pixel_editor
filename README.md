# hex_pixel_editor (name pending) (WIP)

An image editor specialised for pallette based pngs, currently entirely unimplemented/unfinished/WIP.

## Usage:

Running

```sh
hex_pixel_editor <filename>
```

or, more likely

```sh
cargo run -- <filename>
```

will display your image alongside a panel showing the palette.

Very useful, I know.
